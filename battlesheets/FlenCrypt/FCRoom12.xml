Breaking vials of holy water in the path of Ghouls will cause them to hesitate one round, then jump over or run around it.\n\nCommon: Ghouls attack en masse, swarming over prey and digging in\nwith their filthy claws and hiring with rheir fangs. Their touch paralyzes\nhumans and demi-humans (except elves) unless a save vs. paralyzation is . .\nmade. Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric.\nAny human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes\none unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely\nfearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to\nSleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection\nfrom Evil keeps them completely at bay.'
