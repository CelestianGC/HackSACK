    <sDescription>The touch of a ghoul causes paralyzation unless save versus paralyzation is made in all except elves. Lasting d6+2 rounds.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Common Ghouls are undead humans who feed on the flesh ofcorpses. They are vaguely recognizable as the humans chey oncc were, but have become horribly disfigured. Ghouls have long, forked tongues, sharp, elongated teerh and strong claws. All Ghouls look vaguely similar and may continue to wear the tattered remains of wharevcr clothes they had in life. Ghouls are slobbering, flesh-earing maniacs, bur they hunt with an evil cunning. Lacedons arc aquatic Ghouls and alhtough they have webbing between rheir fingers and toes, rhey are in every way just like Ghouls. \n\nCOMBAT/TACTICS: While Ghouls feast only on dead flesh, they have no problem wirh killing something to make it edible. Breaking vials of holy water in the path of Ghouls will cause them to hesitate one round, then jump over or run around it. \n\nCommon: Ghouls attack en masse, swarming over prey and digging in with their filthy claws and hiring with rheir fangs. Their touch paralyzes humans and demi-humans (except elves) unless a save vs. paralyzation is . . made. Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric. Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes one unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely fearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to Sleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection from Evil keeps them completely at bay. \n</sDescription>

    <sDescription>The touch of a ghoul causes paralyzation unless save versus paralyzation is made in all except elves. Lasting d6+2 rounds.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Common Ghouls are undead humans who feed on the flesh ofcorpses. They are vaguely recognizable as the humans chey oncc were, but have become horribly disfigured. Ghouls have long, forked tongues, sharp, elongated teerh and strong claws. All Ghouls look vaguely similar and may continue to wear the tattered remains of wharevcr clothes they had in life. Ghouls are slobbering, flesh-earing maniacs, bur they hunt with an evil cunning. Lacedons arc aquatic Ghouls and alhtough they have webbing between rheir fingers and toes, rhey are in every way just like Ghouls. \n\nCOMBAT/TACTICS: While Ghouls feast only on dead flesh, they have no problem wirh killing something to make it edible. Breaking vials of holy water in the path of Ghouls will cause them to hesitate one round, then jump over or run around it. \n\nCommon: Ghouls attack en masse, swarming over prey and digging in with their filthy claws and hiring with rheir fangs. Their touch paralyzes humans and demi-humans (except elves) unless a save vs. paralyzation is . . made. Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric. Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes one unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely fearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to Sleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection from Evil keeps them completely at bay. \n</sDescription>
