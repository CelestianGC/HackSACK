      <jName>104. ROOM, 30&amp;apos; x 20&amp;apos;</jName>
      <jRoomDescPlayer>The door to the west of harpy hall leads to this place. No exits are apparent. The place reeks of carrion, and filth and bones litter the floor. Heaps of old cloth along the walls indicate where the occupants of the place once nested. Old garments hang from pegs in the wall.\n</jRoomDescPlayer>
      <jRoomDescDM>Encounter: Six ghouls move from here into harpy hall (area 103) if any noise is heard therein, their speed determined by the nature of the sounds (as described above). These foul creatures dwell here in harmony with the harpies and other creatures to the north (in areas 105-107). The harpies are allowed the &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; of killing charmed and other victims, and get their fair share of the morsels thus obtained. Most of the corpses are then taken by the ghouls for later feasting.\n\nGhouls (6): AC 6, MV 9&amp;quot;, HD 2, hp 15, 13,12, 10, 8, 6, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 95, 91, 89, 85, 81, 77\n\nA thorough search reveals 187 cp, 81 sp, 5ep, and 61 gp under the bedding. A suit of elf-sized elfin chainmail hangs under an old cloak on the south wall. (Elven chain may be sold for up to 500 gp, varying by the place and time of sale. It is not normally available for purchase in shops, being highly sought and often reserved for elves,nobles, well-known leaders, and political officials. )</jRoomDescDM>

    <sDescription>The touch of a ghoul causes paralyzation unless save versus paralyzation is made in all except elves. Lasting d6+2 rounds.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Common Ghouls are undead humans who feed on\nthe flesh ofcorpses. They are vaguely recognizable as the humans chey\noncc were, but have become horribly disfigured. Ghouls have long,\nforked tongues, sharp, elongated teerh and strong claws. All Ghouls\nlook vaguely similar and may continue to wear the tattered remains of\nwharevcr clothes they had in life. Ghouls are slobbering, flesh-earing\nmaniacs, bur they hunt with an evil cunning.\nLacedons arc aquatic Ghouls and alhtough they have webbing between\nrheir fingers and toes, rhey are in every way just like Ghouls.\n\nCOMBAT/TACTICS: While Ghouls feast only on dead flesh, they have no problem wirh killing something to make it edible. Breaking vials of holy water in the path of Ghouls will cause them to hesitate one round, then jump over or run around it.\n\nCommon: Ghouls attack en masse, swarming over prey and digging in\nwith their filthy claws and hiring with rheir fangs. Their touch paralyzes\nhumans and demi-humans (except elves) unless a save vs. paralyzation is . .\nmade. Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric.\nAny human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes\none unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely\nfearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to\nSleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection\nfrom Evil keeps them completely at bay.</sDescription>

Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric.\nAny human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes\none unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely\nfearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to\nSleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection\nfrom Evil keeps them completely at bay.</sDescription>
