      <jRoomDescPlayer>The former use of this area cannot be determined, but it is now filled with trash, waste, bones, and the like. It is very odoriferous. Nothing of value is apparent, nor are any exits.\n</jRoomDescPlayer>
      <jRoomDescDM>If the party persists in disturbing the trash, they arouse the 20 giants rats, which attack hungrily. If more than ten of the rats are slain, the rest probably retreat (50% chance, check each round). \n\nRats, giant (20): AC 7, MV 12&amp;quot;//6&amp;quot;, HD 1/2, hp 3 each, #AT 1, D 1-3; XP 10 each\n</jRoomDescDM>

    <sDescription>Swim move is 6.\n\nSpecial attack is disease. Injury by a rat causes disease has a 8.5% chance to cause disease.\n\nCOMBAT/TACTICS: All Rats like to line their nest with shiny objects.\nThey are likely to steal rhese objects in lieu of attacking, as long as they\nare not hungry. Rats can tit through openings half their size by dislocating\nbones and squeezing their bodies through.\n\nCommon Rat: Rats are scavengers, so they will eat almost any organic\nmarerial. Unless controlled, driven by hunger or panicked by movemenr\nor bright lights, Rats are unlikely to attack. Common Rats can\nbe distracted by throwing a significant amount of food in rheir direction.\n(This may encourage the Rats to follow the PCs, looking for more\nfood. When no food is forthcoming and the Rats are hungry, tbey\nattack!) Common Rats fear fire, but can overcome this fear if hungry\nenough (Morale check with 25% bonus). Any injury delivered by a\nRat has a 5% chance of infecting the vicrim with a random disease.\n\nGiant Rat: Giant Rats are wen larger rhan Large Rats and inflict more\ndamage. They areslightly more aggressiveand their bites have an 8.5%\nchance of causing disease.</sDescription>
