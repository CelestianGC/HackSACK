      <jName>115. ROOM, 20&amp;apos; x 30&amp;apos;</jName>
      <jRoomDescPlayer>The south wall of this chamber bears a bas relief of a hideous headâ€” a humanlike face with squashed features, the face\nlow upon a mushroom-shaped cranium. Various humanoids, monsters, and demoniac creatures prance and jape in the background. The remains of a sandstone altar lie in fragments before this sculpture. All furnishings are gone, but six heaps of old clothing, rags and whatnot remain, indicating that something yet dwells herein. A wooden box is near the north door. The west door has a peep hole, usable from inside the room.\n</jRoomDescPlayer>
      <jRoomDescDM>Six ghouls dwell in this area. They pass through the eastern door to investigate any noise coming from the corridor, as noted in area 114. If intruders are discovered, five attack while one hastens to alert those in area 116. \n\nGhouls (6): AC 6, MV 9&amp;quot;, HD 2, hp 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 91, 89, 87, 85, 83, 81\n\nThe box contains an old cloak of no value, 263 cp, and a 6 inch tall finely carved ivory statuette (worth 85 gp). These creatures, like their fellows in areas free run of this sector of the Temple&amp;apos;s upper dungeon to serve as a first line of defense. (It is also hoped that a sufficient force of ghouls and ghasts can be built to be later formed into a contingent of the Temple hordes when they reemerge to war upon the forces of Good. )\n</jRoomDescDM>

    <sDescription>The touch of a ghoul causes paralyzation unless save versus paralyzation is made in all except elves. Lasting d6+2 rounds.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Common Ghouls are undead humans who feed on\nthe flesh ofcorpses. They are vaguely recognizable as the humans chey\noncc were, but have become horribly disfigured. Ghouls have long,\nforked tongues, sharp, elongated teerh and strong claws. All Ghouls\nlook vaguely similar and may continue to wear the tattered remains of\nwharevcr clothes they had in life. Ghouls are slobbering, flesh-earing\nmaniacs, bur they hunt with an evil cunning.\nLacedons arc aquatic Ghouls and alhtough they have webbing between\nrheir fingers and toes, rhey are in every way just like Ghouls.\n\nCOMBAT/TACTICS: While Ghouls feast only on dead flesh, they have no problem wirh killing something to make it edible. Breaking vials of holy water in the path of Ghouls will cause them to hesitate one round, then jump over or run around it.\n\nCommon: Ghouls attack en masse, swarming over prey and digging in\nwith their filthy claws and hiring with rheir fangs. Their touch paralyzes\nhumans and demi-humans (except elves) unless a save vs. paralyzation is . .\nmade. Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric.\nAny human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes\none unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely\nfearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to\nSleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection\nfrom Evil keeps them completely at bay.</sDescription>

Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric.\nAny human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes\none unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely\nfearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to\nSleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection\nfrom Evil keeps them completely at bay.</sDescription>
