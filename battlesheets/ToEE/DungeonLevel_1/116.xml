      <jName>116. ROOM, 30&amp;apos; x 20&amp;apos;</jName>
      <jRoomDescPlayer>The stench of ghouls lies heavily here, as well. Parts of rotting tapestries still adorn the east and west walls. A battered table and two stools occupy the center of the room. Mounds of cloth line the walls, apparently beds for the occupants. A water barrel is near the south door, and a full sack rests near the north door.\n</jRoomDescPlayer>
      <jRoomDescDM>Encounters: Six ghouls residing herein move to aid their fellows as needed. \n\nAdditional Encounters: If necessary, one goes to room 117 to summon more aid, while the other five attack enemies. If intruders approach from the north, the one alerts those in area 115, of course, while the others aid their masters.\n\nGhouls (6): AC 6, MV 9&amp;quot;, HD 2, hp 14, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 93, 85, 83, 81, 79, 79\n\nThe water barrel is placed over a hole in the floor, wherein 192 sp and 47 ep are kept. The sack contains the clothing taken from the current captives (in area 114) and three others as well, now deceased. However, no weapons are here.\n</jRoomDescDM>

    <sDescription>The touch of a ghoul causes paralyzation unless save versus paralyzation is made in all except elves. Lasting d6+2 rounds.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Common Ghouls are undead humans who feed on\nthe flesh ofcorpses. They are vaguely recognizable as the humans chey\noncc were, but have become horribly disfigured. Ghouls have long,\nforked tongues, sharp, elongated teerh and strong claws. All Ghouls\nlook vaguely similar and may continue to wear the tattered remains of\nwharevcr clothes they had in life. Ghouls are slobbering, flesh-earing\nmaniacs, bur they hunt with an evil cunning.\nLacedons arc aquatic Ghouls and alhtough they have webbing between\nrheir fingers and toes, rhey are in every way just like Ghouls.\n\nCOMBAT/TACTICS: While Ghouls feast only on dead flesh, they have no problem wirh killing something to make it edible. Breaking vials of holy water in the path of Ghouls will cause them to hesitate one round, then jump over or run around it.\n\nCommon: Ghouls attack en masse, swarming over prey and digging in\nwith their filthy claws and hiring with rheir fangs. Their touch paralyzes\nhumans and demi-humans (except elves) unless a save vs. paralyzation is . .\nmade. Paralysis lasts for 3-8 rounds or until negated by a cleric.\nAny human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a Ghoul becomes\none unless Blessed or completely devoured. Ghoul packs are completely\nfearless and will attack until destroyed. Ghouls are immune to\nSleep and Charm spells. Clerics can turn them, while a Protection\nfrom Evil keeps them completely at bay.</sDescription>
