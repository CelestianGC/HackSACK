      <jName>118. HALL, 10&amp;apos; x 30&amp;apos;</jName>
      <jRoomDescPlayer>This area is plastered and wainscoated in some (now ruined) wood. It was evidently some form of trophy or museum room, and several broken cases are shoved against the walls. A serviceable but moldy shield hangs on the west wall. Two great heaps of old cloth and pillows and like materials are formed to serve as beds.\n</jRoomDescPlayer>
      <jRoomDescDM>The two ghasts dwelling herein are the leaders of this complex and the one to the southeast (areas 113-117). They are large and lazy, and bully the weaker ghasts and ghouls, getting the best of the food and loot. The larger of this pair gains a + 1 bonus to all &amp;quot;to hit&amp;quot; and damage rolls; it wears a gold chain. Neither ghast retreats as do the others. Unless forced away by a cleric or magic, both stay and fight to the death; they love their life of ease and know that it is lost if they show weakness. \nGhasts (2): AC 4, MV 15&amp;quot;, HD 4, hp 29, 24, #AT 3, D1-4/1-4/1-8, SA touch paralyzes, stench 10&amp;apos; radius = save vs. poison or suffer -2 &amp;quot;to hit&amp;quot; penalty; XP 306, 286\n\nThe larger ghast wears a gold chain worth 7, 000 gp, set with three small rubies worth 1, 000 gp each. The smaller has a ruby ring (worth 4, 000 gp) so encrusted with dirt and filth that it goes unnoticed unless the monster&amp;apos;s left hand is carefully and specifically examined. The shield on the west wall is a shield + 1, long forgotten by the remaining Temple authorities. The only other treasure is worn by the room&amp;apos;s inhabitants.\n</jRoomDescDM>

    <sDescription>﻿DESCRIPTION: Ghasts are Ghoul-like undead who reek of carnon, which helps to distinguish rhem from rheir Ghoulish brethren. \n\nCOMBATITACTICS: Usually found with Ghouls, Ghasts look exactly the same as Ghouls, \nexcept hat they exude a carrion stench in a 10-foot radius. All those in the radius must save vs. ooison or become nauseated and attack at -2 to-hit. Due to their similarity to Ghouls. Ghasts paralyze by touch (the touch of a does affect elves). Ghast paraIyzation lasts 5-10 rounds or until negated by a cleric with a Remove Paralys~s or similar spell. Although they are similar to Ghouls in many respects, turning Ghasts is much harder. They take double damage From cold iron, but protection from Evil does nor keep them at bay unless it is used in conjunction with cold iron.\n\n\n</sDescription>
