      <jName>126. ROOM, 20&amp;apos; x 20&amp;apos;</jName>
      <jRoomDescPlayer>This place appears to have been another visitors&amp;apos; chamber, but the plastered walls are broken and smoke-stained from the struggles of the past. Several couches have been shoved together to form a huge bed in the northeast corner. Several empty sacks lie on the floor, and a nearly full barrel of ale is near the west door. A large table and rude chair are in the northwest corner; a big, yellowish cheese and several hard sausages lie atop the table, beside an empty gallon jug. Under the table is an iron chest. Nine spears, 3 morning stars, and 2 longswords lie piled by the south door.\n</jRoomDescPlayer>
      <jRoomDescDM>Herein dwells an ogre, the chief of the entire ogre force. He reports to the clerics in area 137 from time to time. If he hears a commotion in the corridor or nearby rooms, he probably (90%) ignores it, trusting his flunkies to handle the minor matters. He responds to any direct call for help at his door, of course.\n\nOgre leader: AC 3, MV 9&amp;quot;, HD 4 +1, hp 26, #AT 1, D 5-12 (1d8 + 4, with battle axe); XP 220\n\nThe ogre wears a copper belt worth 35 gp, upon which hangs his purse, containing 11 sp, 19 ep, and 38 gp. The iron chest is locked but not trapped, and contains 311 gp and 2 huge and remarkably perfect agates (worth 100 gp and 500 gp, respectively). The lock can be picked or broken open by 30 points of damage.\n</jRoomDescDM>
