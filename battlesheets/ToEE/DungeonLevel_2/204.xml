   jName='204. ROOM, 30&apos; x 20&apos;'
   jRoomDescPlayer='A fireplace on the east wall and a flowing fountain and basin on the west wall are the most remarkable features of this plastered but unpainted chamber. A large table stands in the center of the room, flanked by a pair of benches; all are a bit too large to be comfortable to humans. A sizeable haunch of some sort of cold meat is on the table. An old barrel stands in the center of the north wall, and holds seven spears. Heaps of bedding lie along the south passageway to the west. '
   jRoomDescDM='Five bugbears are stationed here as guards; two are on watch. In case of attack, the three resting in the western arm of the Ushaped area arrive one round after the first two are engaged. Each bugbear throws a spear before engaging in melee with a morning star. If hard-pressed, one bugbear tries to rouse the clerics in area 205.\n\nBugbears (5): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 + 1, hp 17 each #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star), SA 1 spear each (D 1-6, ranges 1&quot;/2&quot;/3&quot;); XP 203 each\n\nEach bugbear wears a short cape of crimson cloth. Each carries 2-12 gp, 2-12 ep, and 2- 12 sp.'
