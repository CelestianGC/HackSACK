   jName='205b. MAIN CHAMBER'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This 20 &apos;x 30&apos; chamber is thickly strewn with rugs; carpets and tapestries cover the walls. Illumination comes from several candelabra, hanging lamps, and a fireplace. Plush furniture and soft cushions are everywhere. The colors are all bright â€” scarlet, hot orange, fiery gold, and brilliant blue. Small tables hold ewers and cups, and dishes of nuts and sweetmeats. A large box stands near the fireplace. The plastered ceiling is painted with scenes of demons and humans in lewd activities. Under a heap of pillows is a hooded robe of scarlet hue.\n'
