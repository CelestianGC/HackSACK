   jName='217. TRIANGULAR CHAMBER'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This area was once of some importance, for its walls are plastered and painted, and evidence of carpeting can be seen in the corners, though such is now a ruin.\n\nThe floor is covered with litter, filth, bones, and possibly much more. The walls are dirty and stained, with great chunks of plaster pulled off and gouge marks everwhere else below ten foot height. The room stinks. An eight-footlong chain is bolted to the center of the floor.\n'
   jRoomDescDM='An owlbear is kept chained here to guard against unwelcome visitors â€” especially agents of the Fire Temple. As soon as any creature steps into the area, the owlbear begins hissing, clacking its beak, and sounding its strange hooting roars. The noise draws the keeper from area 218 to investigate.\n\nThe owlbear attacks fiercely, barring any passage through its chamber, until slain or forced back by its keeper. (This monster is not well-fed. )\n\nOwlbear: AC 5, MV 12&quot;, HD 5 + 2, hp 38, #AT 3, D 1-6/1-6/2-12, SA &quot;to hit&quot; roll of 18 or more on claw attack means hug for additional 2-16 damage; XP 529\n\nA thorough search of the mess produces 3- 30 each of gp, ep, sp, and cp.'

   sDescription='COMBAT/TACTICS: Owlbears are so ferocious and predictable in conibat, it is easy to taunt them inro craps, over cliffs and even into fighting orher monsters. If it moves, an Owlbear will be likely ro atrack it. \n\nCommon Owlbear: These Owlbears attack prey on sight and always fight to the death (no morale check). If the Owlbear rolls a natural 18 or better with a claw, the victim is dragged into a hug for 2-16 additional poinrs of damage (if the attack roll is a natural 20, it also gets a critical hit!). The victim can then be slashed with the Owlbear&apos;s beak automatically each round. A bend bars/lift gates roll can break rhe Owlbear&apos;s deadly grip. Owlbears fight until their hit points reach -5 before finally keeling over.\n'
