   jName='220. SIDE ROOM'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This small room was evidently meant for minor functionaries of the Water Temple,  for shreds of green draperies still hang from the walls, and part of a dirty green carpet remains in the southwest corner. Four heaps of material, evidently used as sleeping mats, are evenly spaced on the floor. A long bench stands by the east wall, under which is a small keg. A large barrel stands near the north door, with a lumpy sack nearby. Several green cloaks hang from wall pegs.'
   jRoomDescDM='Four bugbear guards are stationed here, in service to the Water Temple. If they hear fighting in the area, they rush out to see what&apos;s happening, arriving in only 1 round. Each wears a green vest-like shirt over armor. Each carries 3-12 gp, 3-12 ep, 3-12 sp, and 3-12 cp.\n\nBugbears (4): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 +1, hp 17, 14, 13, 11, #AT 1, D 1-8 (military fork), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 203, 191, 187, 179\n\nThe small keg contains wine of average quality; the large barrel holds water. The sack contains some bad-smelling meat, a large wheel of cheese, and several loaves of coarse black bread. Under one of the cloaks hangs a battle axe. '
