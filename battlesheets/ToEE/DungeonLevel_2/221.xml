   jRoomDescPlayer='This room is much like the one to the south. A pair of beds are shoved together, with a heavy chest beside them.\n\nA large table and chair are the only other furnishings. Three barrels stand along the south wall.'
   jRoomDescDM='The overseer of the guards of the Water Temple is an ogre, who lives here. He is lazy and rather stupid, and comes only if summoned; but due to his horrible temper, the bugbears hate to summon him. He wears a padded jack sewn with seashells, and uses a green drape as a cape. He wears his hair in a topnot held in place by three silver pins, each set a with pearl (each worth 110 gp).\n\nOgre: AC 3, MV 9&quot;, HD 4 +1, hp 29, #AT 1, D 9-18 (3d4 + 6, with huge trident); XP 235 \n\nThe chest is secured with a large padlock, which can be broken by four blows from a mace or hammer. Inside are various items of apparel, a brass candlestick (worth 1 ep), a rusted saw, 419 cp, 282 sp, 23 ep, 133 gp, and 4pp.'
