   jRoomDescPlayer='Player Area Description...'
   jRoomDescDM='Four bugbears are quartered here, as part of the guard of the Water Temple. They cannot hear fighting elsewhere, and must be summoned to leave this area. Each wears a sleeveless overshirt of green and carries 4-16 cp, 4-16 ep, and 4-16 gp. Their chieftain is quartered in the small room (10&apos; square) immediately to the north, and carries 6 ep, 16 gp, 10 pp, and 4 hematites worth 10 gp each.\n\nThe bugbear chieftain is secretly treating with the bugbears who serve the Air Temple (those in areas 223-226) because he and his fellows know of the offer regarding the trolls (203 and 218-219), and plan to defect en masse to the Air Temple if the Water Temple should win the service of the troll chieftain.\n\nIf he sees a party in the company of a troll, he executes his defection plan. (Naturally, the whole thing is encouraged by Kelno — area 225 — who is promising more pay, more food, and less work. ) If adventurers attempt to parley with the bugbears, the chieftain will most certainly defect from the Water Temple forces if offered sufficient reward — coins, coins, other treasure, spared lives.... All of the bugbears know of the secret door in the passage to the west, and reveals it if given sufficient reason to do so.\n\nBugbear guards (4): AC 5, MV 9 &quot;, HD 3 + 1, hp 18, 15, 13, 9, #AT 1, D 2-8 (glaiveguisarme), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 207, 195, 187, 171\n\nBugbear chieftain: AC 4, MV 9&quot;, HD 4, hp 25, #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star), SA + 1 bonus &quot;to hit&quot; and damage, surprise on 1-3; XP 235'
