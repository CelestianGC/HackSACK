   jName='223. JUMBLED ROOM'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This 20 &apos;x 30&apos; chamber contains many odds and ends of furniture â€” three wooden chairs, two armchairs, a large table, two small tables, a desk, three couches, a cot, and countless cushions and pillows.\n\nOld wall hangings of gray, ivory, and white cover the north and south walls. The east and west walls are plastered and painted with murals showing the evil of Elemental Air. The four torch brackets are empty. A small barrel is near the east door, and a large cask by the west. \n'
   jRoomDescDM='Six bugbears herein have accumulated these &quot;treasures&quot;. If attacked, they tip over the tables to form a barricade, gaining a -2 AC bonus vs. missiles or -1 AC bonus in melee. Each is clad in gray kilt and cloak, the latter with a large black square sewn upon it to indicate the personal retinue of the Air Temple. Each has a pair of spears to throw before melee; each carries 1-4 pp and 2-8 gp. If attacked from the west, they alert the occupants of area 224. They will readily receive the bugbears from the Water Temple, of course, if these cowards indicate their willingness to switch sides.\n\nBugbears (6): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 + 1, hp 19, 16, 14, 13, 13, 12, #AT 1, D 1-8 (bat- tie axe), SA 2 spears each (D 1-6, ranges l&quot;/2&quot;/3&quot;), surprise on 1-3; XP 211, 199, 191, 187, 187, 183 \n\nThe small barrel contains beer, the larger, water. In the lining of one of the upholstered chairs is a ring, lost there long ago (jewelry value 700 gp).\n'
