   jName='224. ROOM 20&apos; x 20&apos;'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This plastered, painted chamber was probably one of the many guest rooms of the Temple. It now holds a cot, two sofas, some cushions, a small table, and a battered cabinet. The carpeting on the floor is of a gray hue, indicating connection to the Air Temple.'
   jRoomDescDM='Four bugbears, the personal guards of the cleric Kelno (area 225), are on duty here. Each wears a scale naail jack, gray kilt and cape, and has 1-6 pp, 1-6 gp, 1-6 ep, and 1-6 sp. Each is armed with bardiche and mace, the latter to be hurled at foes before melee. They are accompanied by two gnolls who also wear gray kilts and capes, but over chain mail jacks. These creatures are tolerated well due to \n(a) Kelno&apos;s demand that they be accepted, \n(b) their own toughness, and \n(c) their fast and accurate use of longbows. Each has 18 arrows and a longbow, to be used while trying to avoid close combat. Each carries 3-12 gp, 3-12 ep, and 3-12 sp.\n\nBugbears (4): AC 4, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 + 1, hp 20, 17, 15, 11, #AT 1, D 2-8 (bardiche), SA 1 mace each for hurling (D 2-7, range 0&quot;/1&quot;/ 2&quot;), surprise on 1-3; XP 215, 203, 195, 179\n\nGnolls (2): AC 4, MV 9&quot;, HD 2, hp 16, 14, #AT 1 or 2, D 1-8 (battle axe) or 1-6/1-6 (longbow); XP 68, 64 \n\nInside the cabinet are some old clothes, five wax candles, a quart of honey, and a hand axe. \n\nThe small room to the south, quarters of the gnolls, has nothing in it but two piles of old tapestries and rags (bedding) and four spears standing in a far corner. \n'
