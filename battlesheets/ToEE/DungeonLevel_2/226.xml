   jName='226. KITCHEN'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This place is dirty and full of litter, but has been used of late. Ashes are in both fireplaces on the west wall. The long trestles which run down the center of the room are filled with earthenware dishes and food scraps. Four barrels stand along the south wall. Some large blackish sausages are strung over the ceiling arches. Heaps of old rags and skins are piled helter-skelter in all the corners; this place is apparently used as a camp as well as a mess hall.\n\nThe pantry area to the northeast likewise shows evidence of use. The shelves are filled with unappetizing foodstuffs, plus sacks of millet, beets, and meal.'
   jRoomDescDM='Six bugbears are staying here, new recruits of the Air Temple. Kelno (225) has them stay here in the kitchen where he feeds his troops, and harrangues them about overthrowing the enemies of Elemental Air Evil so his rivals won&apos;t learn about his added forces. If summoned, the bugbears gladly fight with their fellows against any opponents. Each has been given a gray cloak and 20 gp; each also has 1-6 ep, 1-6 sp, and 1-6 cp.\n\nHere also are four goblins, kept as servants. They are quasi-slaves, though their masters have promised them a small share of the expected spoils, good fun torturing prisoners, and even a place in the fighting forces of the Air Temple. Each goblin has only 2-5 cp.\n\nBugbears (6): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 +1, hp 17, 14, 13, 13, 11, 10, #AT 1, D 1-8 (battle axe), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 203, 191, 187, 187, 179, 175 \n\nGoblins (4): AC 6, MV 6&quot;, HD 1-1, hp 6, 5, 4, 3, #AT 1, D 1-6 (shortsword); XP 16, 15, 14, 13 \n\nTwo barrels contain water, one beer, and one wine. No treasure is here other than that carried by the inhabitants.\n'
