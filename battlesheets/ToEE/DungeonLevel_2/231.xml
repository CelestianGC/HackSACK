   jName='231. ROOM OF THE ELEMENTS'
   jRoomDescPlayer='The walls of this small room are covered with scenes showing all four principles of Elemental Evil in their most horrible and disgusting forms. Some battered and torn furnishings also indicate that this place was probably once a sitting room or lounge for some high Temple official.\n\nThe wall sconces are of bronze, as is the wall basin set in a hemispherical alcove in the east wall. A small table, two chairs, a couch, and a broken cabinet are also in the room. \n'
   jRoomDescDM='Four bugbears are on guard here. At the time of the party&apos;s approach, one may (60% chance) be watching through a small port in the north door. Assuming that the party is approaching by way of the outer corridor, the bugbears then cannot be surprised; if the party continues west, the guards alert those in area 232. Each bugbear wears black armor, indicating that they are in service to the overall Temple (aloof from the individual Elemental factions and, therefore, the other bugbears in this dungeon level). Each carries a spear, to be hurled before melee, and each has 2-12 gp, 2-12 ep, and 2-12 sp.\n\nBugbears (4): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 +1, hp 13, 12, 11, 11, #AT 1, D 1-8 (battle axe), SA 1 spear each (D 1-6, ranges 1&quot;/2&quot;/ 3&quot;), surprise on 1-3; XP 187, 183, 179, 179\n\n\n'
