   jName='232. SALON'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This 30 &apos; x 40 &apos; room was once quite splendid, if its wall hangings, carpet remnants, and battered furnishings are any gauge. Cressets and sconces of bronze line the walls. Four small tables, six chairs, two couches, and two sideboards are here, as well as several boxes and chests. A large iron pot hangs from a bronze chain in the middle of the room (suspended from the place some filagreed lamp once hung) over a charcoal fire in a bronze bowl, its original purpose unknown. \n'
   jRoomDescDM='Seven bugbears, males in service to the overall Temple (and thus clad in black) are quartered here. With them are six females, who do not fight unless the males are obviously in trouble. All 13 bugbears will lay an ambush if alerted by the guards in area 231, and will summon those in 233 to help.\n\nBugbears (7 male): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 3 + 1, hp 19, 16, 15, 15, 13, 12, 9, #AT 1, D 2-7 (flail), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 211, 199, 195, 195, 187, 183, 171 \n\nBugbears (6 female): AC 6, MV 9&quot;, HD 2, hp 13, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8, #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star); XP 70, 64, 62, 60 (x3)\n\nEach male has 2-12 gp, 2-12 ep, and 2-12 sp. Each female has 1-6 ep and 2-12 sp.\n\nThe boxes and chests hold only old clothing, food, and junk. The iron pot contains a stew of questionable composition. The door to the south leads into a 10&apos; x 20&apos; room which is filled with various poor but edible foodstuffs, some meats and cheeses, and barrels of grain, flour, biscuits, beer, vinegar, wine, and salt.\n'
