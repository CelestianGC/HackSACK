   jName='233. SIDE CHAMBER'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This 20&apos; square room shows signs of having been the sleeping chamber of some personage of importance. The walls are plastered and bear murals, albeit the plaster is now broken and stained and most of the painting is ruined. Rugs are still on the floor, and a huge bed stands in the southwest corner. Another heap of bedding and pillows occupies the northwest corner. A cabinet stands beside the bed, along with a small table, a large wardrobe, and a brazier. Two lamps hang from ceiling chains,and four sconces adorn the walls.\n'
   jRoomDescDM='The leader of the bugbears and his lieutenant occupy this room with three females (who are comely, as bugbears goâ€” though they do not go far in that direction). All are clad in black. The leader and lieutenant are unusually strong, gaining damage bonuses of + 2 and + 1 (respectively) with any held or hurled weapon; each carries a spear in battle, to be hurled before engaging with other weapons. The females are aggressive, and fight with the males.\n\nThe largest male wears a gold chain from which depends a golden skull emblem (jewelry value 175 gp), and carries a pouch containing 23 gp, 15 pp, and 6 bits of turquoise (each worth 10 gp). The lieutenant carries 3 pp, 14 gp, 5 ep, and 19 sp. Each female has 1-6 gp, 1-6 ep, 1-6 sp, and 1-6 cp, and the largest also wears a silver earring with a mounted jasper gem (worth 100 gp).\n\nBugbear leader: AC 3, MV 9&quot;, HD 4, hp 30, #AT 1, D 4-10 (bastard sword), SA hurl spear (D 1-6, ranges 1&quot;/2&quot;/3&quot;), surprise on 1-3; XP 255 \n\nBugbear lieutenant: AC 4, MV 9&quot;, HD 4, hp 25, #AT 1, D 3-9 (bardiche), SA hurl spear, surprise on 1-3; XP 235 \n\nBugbear females (3): AC 5, MV 9&quot;, HD 2 +1, hp 15, 13, 12, #AT 1, D1-8 (battle axe), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 125, 119, 115 \n\nThe wardrobe is stuffed with old clothing, some tapestries (one of which is worth 350 gp), a sack of food, 5 bottles of wine, and miscellaneous junk. \n'
