   jName='241. SIDE CHAMBER'
   jRoomDescPlayer='Player Area Description...'
   jRoomDescDM='A slightly torn hanging on the south wall of area 240 conceals a door, which is pierced by a small window closed with an iron shutter. The door has no handle on the north side, and is barred from the south. Behind this door, watching the junk room from his position on a stool, is a guard. While observing the junk room through a tear in the hanging, he keeps a firm grip on a piece of twine, strung between his position and that of two other guards currently resting in the inner chamber (to the immediate west, 10&apos; x 20&apos;). The 10&apos; square cubicle of the watcher&apos;s position is separated from the inner chamber by a large heavy drape.\n\nIf the watcher sees intruders, he pulls the twine, which causes a billet of wood to thump and alert them, its noise dampened by the drape between the areas. If anyone approaches the concealed entrance, the guard fires a light crossbow through the window (gaining a + 4 bonus to hit), slams the shutter closed, and retreats to the inner room. All three guards then prepare to fire crossbows at intruders breaking through the concealed doorâ€”but only after alerting the other guards in area 242. A knock spell opens the bar and the door easily, but the portal otherwise takes 50 points of damage before collapsing.\n\nEach guard wears chain mail armor and shield, and carries a longsword as well as a light crossbow with 30 bolts. Each has 2-8 gp. If captured and questioned, the guards admit to being part of a raiding force which scouts for the Temple and generally supplies it, brings captives, and recruits others (both human and humanoid) to serve.\n\nGuards (3): AC 4 (chain &amp; shield), MV 9&quot;, Level 0, hp 6, 5, 4, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword) or 2-5 (light crossbow), XP 20, 19, 18\n\nThe guardpost contains only a stool. In the area west of the drape are two chairs and a table, a barrel with 48 extra crossbow bolts, and a cask of water. Two torches burn in wall sconces, and a hooded lantern on the table is lit. Beside the lantern are three mugs and a jug of wine.'
