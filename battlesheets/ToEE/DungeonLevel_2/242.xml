   jName='242. CROOKED CORRIDOR'
   jRoomDescPlayer='This passage is lined with double bunks, ten in all. Each has a straw mattress, and two small boxes are tucked underneath, head and foot. Three torches are mounted in wall sconces, but only one, on the south wall, is lit.\n\nA not-very-secret door is in the west wall at the bend in the corridor. Above it, positioned horizontally, is a large beam, studded with sharp spikes. It seems to be fastened to a hinge at the west end, and supported by a cord at the east, which connects to a fastening on the door. None of the bunks block the door or stand below the beam.\n'
   jRoomDescDM='This area is a cramped barracks for 20 guards, quarters of those in area 241. Four are herein, with their leader, a swordsman (Level 3 Fighter); the others are out on a raiding expedition. All are clad in black.\n\nEach guardsman carries 2-8 gp; the leader wears a gold chain (worth 150 gp) set with a large jet gem (worth 100 gp), and carries 27 gp in a belt pouch.\n\nIf combat goes badly, the leader pulls a torch on the south wall (which opens a secret door to area 243) and get help from the bandits therein while stepping out of the fray himself. As he is rather arrogant, feeling his abilities to be equal to nearly any test, he does not get the bandits unless invaders are obviously winning. The guards and their leader all wear chain mail armor and carry shields. The leader gains a -3 AC bonus due to his 17 Dexterity, and a + 1 damage bonus (Strength 15), but does not normally use a shield.\n\nGuards (4): AC 4 (chain &amp; shield), MV 9&quot;, Level 0, hp 7, 5, 5, 4, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword);XP 17, 15, 15, 14 \n\nLeader: AC 2 (chain mail), MV 9&quot;, Level 3 Fighter, hp 19, #AT 1, D 3-9 (bastard sword); XP 92\n\nMany small but worthless items, such as clothing, footwear, sacks, rope, et al. are under the bunks and in the boxes, but no treasure is here. The south torch is the one which, if pulled down, opens a three-footwide, four-foot-tall secret door leading to area 243.\n\nThe spiked beam is a trap on the secret door leading to area 245 (q. v. ). An attempt to disconnect (remove) it, if unsuccessful, inflicts 2-12 points of damage to the person making the attempt, as the beam swings down and smashes the secret door open with a crash.'
