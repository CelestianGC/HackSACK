   jRoomDescDM='Brunk, a half-ore Fighter/Assassin, dwells here. As previously noted, he hates Feldrin and covets his command. Brunk dresses in black leather armor and wears a short black cape as well. His black shield, adorned with the device of the red horned skull, is specially designed to hold six darts, each of which is treated with deadly poison (though the victim gains a + 2 bonus to the saving throw). He also wears a ring of protection + 2, and a gold earring (100 gp) inset with a tiny ruby worth 1, 000 gp. His purse holds 8 ep and 16 gp. Brunk knows little of the Greater Temple â€”only what Feldrin has told him. In case of attack he alerts those in area 243 or 244 (as appropriate) before emerging for battle. He tries to use his darts (fire rate 3 per round, with + 1 &quot;to hit&quot; bonus due to 16 Dexterity) before engaging, and of course uses his assassin skills if possible.\n\nBrunk: AC 4 (leather &amp; shield), MV 12&quot;, Level 4/4 Fighter/Assassin, hp 28, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword) or 2-5 (dagger + 1), SA 6 poisoned darts, class abilities; XP 868'
